#Blogging Website

I have created this project to demonstrate the final project for my CINS 465 class, which is a class to learn Django development.
I have implemented a blogging website, which has many categories in it, such as Politics, World news, Sports, Cinema, and many more.
I have used HTML, CSS for front end and used Django for backend.
